                Housing costs may vary tremendously between Europe and around
                the cities in Europe. To illustrate this, it is enough to think
                of the fact that renting a flat in London’s or Paris’ city
                centers can be quite pricey, while German cities or those of
                Finland, for instance, offer a more reasonable scope for living.
                Another way universities offer financial aid is by providing
